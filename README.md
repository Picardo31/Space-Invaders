Space Invaders is a classic arcade video game that was released in 1978. It was created by Tomohiro Nishikado and published by Taito.

In the game, the player controls a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen and their objective is to defeat waves of descending aliens. The aliens move left and right, gradually moving closer to the bottom of the screen. The player must shoot the aliens and avoid their projectiles. As the game progresses, the aliens become faster and their formations become more complex, posing a greater challenge to the player.

The player's cannon has a limited number of lives and must avoid getting hit by the aliens' projectiles. If an alien reaches the bottom of the screen or the player loses all their lives, the game ends. The player's score increases by shooting down aliens, and the ultimate goal is to achieve a high score.

Space Invaders was a huge success and popularized the shooter genre. Its simple yet addictive gameplay, along with its innovative features like dynamic difficulty and high score tracking, made it a groundbreaking title. It became a cultural phenomenon and is often credited with popularizing video games as a form of entertainment.
